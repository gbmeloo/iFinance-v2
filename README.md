## Enhancements and Future Updates

### Planned Features
I have plans for future improvements on the app and I'm planning to implement several features in future updates:

2. Multi-Currency Support: Enabling users to choose their preferred currency for expenses.
Expense Categorization: Enhancing the category feature to allow the removal of categories and better organization.
3. Mobile Application: Developing a mobile version for convenient on-the-go expense management.
